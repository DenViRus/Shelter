1. [Demo Week 1](https://DenViRus.github.io/Shelter/src/pages/main/main.html)

---

**[Shelter. Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/tKcmzkARtMUFQAR9VLdLkl/shelter-dom)**

## Stages of task completion

**[Week 1](#week-1)**: Static markup of the `main` page.

**[Week 2](#week-2)**: Static markup of the `pets` page.

- at these stages, you should create a static markup for the two pages. With the fixed layout, the pages look identical if the window width is at least 1280px.

**[Week 3](#week-3)**: Responsive markup.
- at this stage, you should adapt the previously created pages according to the layout for different window sizes up to 320px.

**[Week 4](#week-4)**: Additional functionality.
- at this stage, additional functionality is going to be added to previously designed pages: slider, pagination, popup.
## Layout
- [Figma layout](https://www.figma.com/file/tKcmzkARtMUFQAR9VLdLkl/shelter-dom);

## Technical requirements

The PerfectPixel extension for Google Chrome can be used for comparison with designs. _[PerfectPixel for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en)_
Compatible browsers: **Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox**. We primarily develop for Google Chrome. Then we check to see if Mozilla Firefox is breaking our styles.
It's **prohibited** to use CSS frameworks (bootstrap, foundation, etc.).
It's **prohibited** to use JS frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, etc.).
It's **prohibited** to use legacy libraries (jQuery, etc.).
It's **allowed** to use up-to-date libraries with a set of helper functions (lodash). You can use Lodash as well as utils for the creation of a slider, pagination, and popups. However, it's recommended to use pure JavaScript.
It's **allowed** to use icon fonts and CSS preprocessors (SCSS).
It's **recommended** to use [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
Please pay attention to the following points:

- The main blocks should be exactly located on the given screen width, as in the Figma designs.
- Images and logos (if any) should be located within a logical container with the correct centering and positioning approach. A slight deviation from the layout is allowed in favor of a grid or column structure.
- Icons and pictures should keep the ideal distance to the beginning of the corresponding text.
- Icons and pictures should keep their proportions.
- If the correct font is used, check the height of the text - it should match the source. The width may vary. But the common practice is to add the `letter-spacing` property to the text of headings, mottos, or quotes.
- If there are several objects in a row of visually the same width, then the width of the blocks containing them must be the same. The difference in image sizes does not matter, what matters is the matching of block sizes. If the width of the blocks in the layout is different, then you still need to make it the same.
- Some elements should be interactive. The layout contains separately designed blocks describing what the button or element looks like with and without the hover effect.
  "Interactive" means that a button or element has a visual effect or animation (at your discretion based on the layout: cursor animation, background color change, dimming, underline, font change) during some user action, for example, on hover. It is not necessary to use JavaScript to handle custom events in this task. Usually, this effect is implemented using the `:hover` pseudo-class and the following properties:
- `cursor: pointer`,
- `background`,
- `text-decoration: underline`,
- `color`.

## Repository requirements

- Public repository named shelter on your GitHub account.
- You may use the example of project structure below. Since the project will contain several pages (2), at the same level as `assets` there will be the `pages` directory. Inside `pages`, in the `main` folder (same as the page name), the `.html`, `.css` and `.js` files related to this page will be stored. The `assets` directory will still contain images, icons, and font files if any. The folders inside `assets` will be named depending on the content: `images`, `icons`, `fonts`. Example below:
- ![shelter folder structure](./src/img/shelter-folder-structure.jpg)
- You should deploy your task using gh-pages or by any other means.
- The commit history should reflect the development process of the application. Commit names should match the [commit requirements](https://docs.rs.school/#/git-convention)

## Useful links

Fonts can be found here:

[Arial, google fonts](https://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/arial?QueryFontType=Web&src=GoogleWebFonts)

[Georgia, google fonts](https://www.fonts.com/font/microsoft-corporation/georgia?QueryFontType=Web&src=GoogleWebFonts)

You can connect fonts by either downloading local files or connecting fonts via URL to google fonts. If you can't find or download the font you need, just replace it with a font with the same serif type.

## Week 1

The original width of the provided layout is 1280px. The width of the wrapper or guide columns is 1200px. The sizes of internal blocks are recommended to be set in relative values (%, vw) in order not to rewrite CSS styles for responsive layout.
When the window width is above 1280px, the layout should remain centered, and not stretch to the full width of the window. To fill the free space, you can either stretch the backgrounds of the corresponding blocks to the entire width of the window, or use any of the colors present in the [designs](https://www.figma.com/file/tKcmzkARtMUFQAR9VLdLkl/shelter-dom):

- The image of the dog, address and contacts are different blocks that should not overlap.
- The background of the block can be made with a gradient.

## Cross-check evaluation criteria. Week 1

Open the application at 1280px screen width. If the screen is smaller, you can zoom in, or you can set the page width to 1280px and observe with the visible horizontal scrollbar. If the screen is wider, you can make the area narrower or narrow the window. If the vertical scroll is present, in some cases the width may not match the one that displays the value in the dev tools (the offset can be up to 17px). When checking, keep this in mind and make sure that the width is set correctly.
The task is checked exclusively according to the criteria specified below. If you see some kind of defect or mistake in the work that does not match a criterion, the score should not be decreased. But you can highlight it in the comments.
If during the check, you don't know whether to lower the score or not, then you shouldn't. For example, if wrong numbers are entered in the **You can also make a donation** block inside the button, then this will not be considered a mistake, the score shouldn't be reduced.
‚ùó The score cannot go below **0** per page. Unless otherwise stated in the requirements, all non-repeating blocks or elements without `hover` should meet the following criteria:

- Indents from the borders of elements (or sets of elements) to the edges of the block, horizontally or vertically, differ by more than 20px: **-1** for each block.
- Margins within a set or grid between elements, horizontally or vertically, differ by more than 10px: **-1** per block.
- The background color of the block or element differs from the design (does not apply to the position of the gradient or stretched image): **-1** for each block.
- Missing element or picture, both background and element picture: **-1** for each block.
- font-family is not included, or difference in font size is more than 4px: **-1** per block.

## Week 3

Pay attention to additions:

- **[Repository requirements](#repository-requirements)**
- **[First paragraph in a section: Cross-check evaluation criteria. Week 1](#cross-check-evaluation-criteria-week-1)**

### Task verification features

The task will be evaluated by resizing the Google Chrome browser window, or by connecting device emulation through the developer panel (DevTools -> Toggle Device Toolbar). Evaluation the project on real mobile devices or tablets is **not required**.
‚ùó Make sure you don't have a vertical scroll bar when you check, because it takes part of the responsive layout space with its width. To disable it, you must select the `Responsive` emulation mode, as well as set the device type to `Mobile`. If the device type is not displayed, in the top bar of the `device toolbar`, click on the three dots on the right and select `Add device type`.
![responsive](./src/img/shelter-responsive.png)
**"responsive"** are sizes given in relative values from the width of the window or parent block, which smoothly change their values when the browser window is reduced or enlarged. The main thing is that when imposing a picture, for example, at 768px on a layout with a width of 768px, the sizes or indents should match.
‚ùó The page should not fall apart, which means that padding, block sizes, and so on, should not go beyond the right edge of the screen and there should not be a horizontal scroll, up to a threshold value (less than 320px).

## 1280px <= width

The layout requirements of [week 1](#week-1) of the project are met: either the blocks continue their color to the entire available area of the window, and the wrapper itself (1200px) is centered (the gradient can also change the width), or the layout takes a maximum width of 1280px and centered with equal indents on the right and left, white or any other color from the layout (when checking, if it will be difficult to see the integrity on a large screen, you can set the body element's background-color property of any contrasting color in the developer panel).

## 768px <= width < 1280px

### Main Page

1. **Header** (`<header>` contains only the logo and navigation bar)

- The logo is nailed closer to the top of the page.
- Padding to the left of the logo and to the right of the navigation menu must be hardcoded, as in the `768px` layout.
- There is no need to make the header "sticky". It means that when scrolling, it remains in its position.

2. **Not only** section

- The title with the text "Not only people need a house" should be positioned as indicated on the layout, i.e. the line wrapping must match the layout. To do so, you can make an additional wrapper, which is centered relative to the main blocks. Only indentation can be `responsive`, but the indentation on the left must match the indentation of the next block of text.
- The block with the text "We offer to give..." should be centered with equal margins on the edges. Block with text and padding can be `responsive`.
- The "Make a Friend" button should be centered and rigidly sized like the `768px` layout.
- The dog picture can be `responsive`, but the offset to the right must remain proportional, i.e. padding to the right margin can also be `responsive`.

3. **About** section

- The title with the text "About the shelter..." should be positioned as indicated on the layout, i.e. the line wrapping must match the layout. To do so, you can make an additional wrapper, which is centered relative to the main blocks. Only indentation can be `responsive`, but the indentation on the left must match the indentation of the next block of text.
- Blocks with the text "Currently..." and "We feed our..." should be centered with equal margins on the edges. Block with text and padding can be `responsive`.
- A picture of a cat and a dog, its indents can be `responsive`. The main thing is that the picture is centered.

4. **Our Friends** section

- The header block must be centered. Block with text and padding can be `responsive`.
- Instead of three blocks with pets, there should now be two. Pet blocks are rigidly sized, as in the `assets` layout. In this case, the indents between blocks, slider arrows or screen edges can be `responsive`.
- The "Get to know the rest" button should be centered and rigidly sized like the `768px` layout.

5. **Help** section

- The header block must be centered. Block with text and padding can be `responsive`.
- Elements are arranged in a 3 x 3 grid. Either the grid increases in proportion to the size of the screen or the indents between the elements and the edges of the screen can be `responsive`. The grid structure should not change.

6. **In addition** section

- The block with the text "You can..." must be positioned as indicated on the layout, i.e. line wrapping must match the layout. To do so, you can make an additional wrapper, which is centered relative to the main blocks. Only indentation can be `responsive`, but the indentation on the left must match the indentation of the next block of text.
- The block with the "Name of the bank..." text should be located as indicated on the layout. To do so, you can make an additional wrapper, which is centered relative to the main blocks. Only padding can be `responsive`, but the left padding must match the next button padding.
- The button with the bank account number should be located as indicated on the layout and have a fixed size, as on the `768px` layout. To do so, you can make an additional wrapper, which is centered relative to the main blocks. Only indentation can be `responsive`, but the indentation on the left must match the indentation of the next block of text.
- The block with the "Legal information..." text should be centered with equal margins on the edges. Block with text and padding can be `responsive`.
- Dog picture and padding can be `responsive`. The main thing is that the picture is centered.

7. **Footer** (`<footer>` contains contacts, address and image):

- There is a grid of two columns. Please note that the grid block itself must be centered, i.e. the distance to the left of the first column is the same as the distance to the right of the second column. In this case, the columns themselves and indents can be `responsive`.
- Dog picture and padding can be `responsive`. The main thing is that the picture is centered.

### Pets Page

1. **Header** (`<header>` —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏—Ç —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –ª–æ–≥–æ—Ç–∏–ø –∏ –ø–∞–Ω–µ–ª—å –Ω–∞–≤–∏–≥–∞—Ü–∏–∏)
1. **Header** (`<header>` contains only the logo and navigation bar)

- The logo is nailed closer to the top of the page.

- Block with buttons should be centered. Button sizes and spacings are hardcoded, like on `assets`, or like on the `768px` layout. Padding to the edges of the screen can be `responsive`.

3. **Footer** (`<footer>` contains contacts, address and image):

- There is a grid of two columns. Please note that the grid box itself must be centered, i.e. the distance to the left of the first column is the same as the distance to the right of the second column. In this case, the columns themselves and indents can be `responsive`.
- Dog picture and padding can be `responsive`. The main thing is that the picture is centered.

## 320px <= width < 768px

- One single column. The indents of all elements to the edges of the screen must match. The column itself must be centered. At the same time, both the column itself and the indents to the edges of the screen can be `responsive`.
- Dog picture and padding can be `responsive`. The main thing is that the picture is centered.

## width < 320px

Minimum layout width = 320px. After the threshold value, the location of the layout does not matter. The layout structure remains the same with a width of 320px. If at some moment during screen resolution reduction the layout "breaks" it's not a mistake.

## Cross-check evaluation criteria. Week 3

‚ùó **Important note #1**: When changing the width using the dev tools and having a vertical scrollbar, the discrepancy can be up to 17px (standard vertical scrollbar width). In this case, you must either change the width by the amount of this discrepancy or go to [task verification features](#task-verification-features) so that there is no vertical scrollbar.
‚ùó **Important note #2**: When scaling the screen (for example, zoom+ 125%), the actual width may differ by 1-2 pixels. For example, the real value could be 767 or 769, although the developer tools will show 768. Therefore, you need to shift to the transition point, despite the difference.
‚ùó **Important note #3**: The only block in which elements do not have to follow a structure is the `Help` block. If the elements are listed as enumerated elements, then when checking for responsive layout, the indents from the edge of the block to the elements, as well as the number in the row, are not taken into account and the points are not reduced. It also does not evaluate whether elements are centered or nailed to the left. However, size violation is taken into account, be careful!
‚ùó **Important note #4**: Checking for full compliance with layouts by Perfect Pixel occurs only at the corresponding breakpoints - 1280px, 768px, 320px. At all intermediate values, the absence of exact following of indents and sizes is allowed, but it is recommended to follow the principles of the arrangement of certain elements that are not noted in specific requirements.

---

‚ùó **Check out some definitions**:

- A **padding violation** is a situation where the distance between elements, or the distance from an element to the edge of the container it is contained in, differs from the one set on the layout by more than 10 pixels in height or width.
  Consider the situation using the `our friends` section as an example. You will most likely know the approximate distance between elements by eye. However, you are confused by the indentation of the "left" button from the edge of the screen on the left. The distance from the "left" button to the left border of the block is 40px on a screen width of 1280px. So, setting the width to 1280px, we look at the distance. If it differs by up to 10px inclusive (for example, 50px or 30px) - do not remove points. However, if the indents are greater than these values ‚Äã‚Äã(for example, 51px or 29px), we remove the specified number of points.
- **Size Violation** is a situation when the dimensions of elements (buttons, pictures, animal cards, icons) differ from those specified on the layout by more than 10 pixels in height or width. The check is carried out in the same way as in case of violation of indents, and if the differences are large, we remove the specified number of points.
- The length of the text and words in width, as well as the order of word wrapping in lines, we **do not take into account when checking**.
- **Unique error** is the new error found in the block being checked. Regardless of how many times this error is repeated in the block being checked, the specified number of points is deducted only 1 time.
  For example, the button in all animal cards moved out. We will remove points only once because most likely the general style is broken. If there is only one card with the button that has moved down (and in the rest, the button is in its place), we still remove the indicated number of points, i.e. there is no difference, the error is in one repeated element, or in several.

### General check of application behavior when window width is changed

Even if the screen is stretched to 4k, even if it is reduced to 320px, the integrity of the application should not be lost. With smooth resizing, we do not take into account the exact calculations of the location of elements. At this stage, we check on the **Google Chrome** browser for:

- no horizontal scroll bar on any screen width up to 320px;
- elements should not go beyond the side borders of the screen\* for any screen width up to 320px.
  If both conditions in the **Google Chrome** browser are met (the site behaves responsively, the elements and the general structure change sizes along with the change in width, the horizontal scrollbar does not appear and the elements do not go beyond the sides of the window), then set **+ 50** per page. In total, we put **+100** for 2 pages.
  If a horizontal scrollbar appears on the page, or if the content goes beyond the side of the screen, set **0** per page.\*\*
  After checking the responsiveness of the layout in the Google Chrome browser, a similar check is performed in the **Mozilla Firefox** browser, in which:
- if a horizontal scrollbar appears when resizing the browser window from the maximum to 320px, or the content goes off the screen, **-20** points are removed.
- if the horizontal scrollbar does not appear when the browser window is resized from the maximum to 320px, the content does not go off the screen, but some other layout problems appear (other than those in Google Chrome) - ** -5 is removed for each** with a description of the problem, but **no more than -20**.
  The maximum number of points that can be deducted if there are errors during the check on the **Mozilla Firefox** browser - **-20**.\*\*\* \* _when the screen width is <768px, the burger menu can go beyond the side border of the screen. Because this is normal practice, it is not considered an error if the horizontal scrolling does not appear on the page._
  \*\* _if a page is set to 0 during the general check, no further criteria related to that page are checked._
  \*\*\* _further check only happens in Google Chrome browser_

### 1280px <= width (maximum -10 points per page)

When checking on large screens, it is acceptable:
**1) block backgrounds are stretched to the full width of the window**, while the content itself is in the center of the screen and corresponds to the layout;
**2) the layout occupies a maximum width of 1280px** and matches the layout, is centered with equal indents on the left and right, the free space is filled with any color;
For any of the cases above, it is **considered an error** if the content is not centered, i.e. aligned to the right or the left side. In case of such an error **-10** points penalty applied per page.
If the content is centered, we check if it matches the 1280px layout. To do so:

- set window width to 1280px
- check for indentation violations or size violations.
  For each unique error in indentation violation or size violation, **-3** is deducted, **but not more than -10 in total**.
  **3) content is stretched across the entire width of the window**:
  In this case, the following conditions are additionally checked:

#### Main Page

## Week 4

Each of the pets will be represented as an object with a set of data, for example:

```javascript
const pet = {
  name: "Jennifer",
  img: "../../assets/images/jennifer.png",
  type: "Dog",
  breed: "Labrador",
  description:
    "Jennifer is a sweet 2 months old Labrador that is patiently waiting to find a new forever home. This girl really enjoys being able to go outside to run and play, but won't hesitate to play up a storm in the house if she has all of her favorite toys.",
  age: "2 months",
  inoculations: ["none"],
  diseases: ["none"],
  parasites: ["none"],
};
```

‚ùó Each DOM object (block) with a pet description (slider, pagination, or popup) will be generated from the object data. There can be fields in the object that you come up with and name by yourself. There is just an example above.
**[Data of all 8 pets in `JSON` format!](./src/json/pets.json)**

### Main Page

#### Burger menu

- The burger menu will only appear on the page if the width is < 768px.
- When you click on the burger menu, there will be a 320px wide, full-height block on the right side of the browser window with vertically arranged and centered menu items. There should be a slide-in animation.
- The elements have the same active and inactive rules as the menus on the larger screen width. For example, clicking on `Contacts` should take us to the _Footer_ block, and the menu should close.
- The area beyond 320px should be dimmed. The dimming property is described in the Figma layout design.
- When the menu is opened, the menu icon is rotated 90 degrees. There should be an animation of icon rotation. The vertical scrollbar should become inactive.
- If you click outside the menu boundaries, on a darkened area, or on the button with the burger menu icon, the menu should move back in. A slide-out animation must be present.
- When closing the menu, the menu icon itself rotates back 90 degrees. There should be an animation of icon rotation. The vertical scroll must become active again.
- Logo on the burger menu is duplicated from the main one. It is allowed to make the page logo disappear or be moved to its place in the burger menu when the burger menu is opened.

#### Carousel

- The slider should be implemented with arrow buttons. Slides will change on the arrow buttons click.
- The slider is infinite, and has no boundaries, i.e. you can click left and right as many times as you want, and each time the content in the blocks will be a new one. In our case, each new slide will contain a **pseudorandom** set of pets, i.e. it will be generated from the original objects in random order, with two conditions. First, no pet cards will be repeated in the slide block itself. Second, in the next block, there will be no duplicate cards with the cards of the current block. For example, in a slider of 3 elements, the next departing slide will contain 3 new pet cards, such that there were none among the 3 cards on the previous departed slide.
- Either of the two scenarios is allowed:
  - When the left or right arrow button is pressed, regardless of the pressing sequence, new content is always generated.
  - One previous slide is allowed to remain, i.e. if you press "left", "right", "left" (or the reverse sequence), the content that was before the first press "left" (or "right" in the reverse sequence) is returned. All other slides generate new content.
- When the page is refreshed, the cards can be anything, not just those on the figma design.
- At 1280px <= width there are 3 pets in the slide block.
- When 768px <= width < 1280px there are 2 pets in the slide block.
- At width < 768px there is 1 pet in the slide block.
- You don't need to switch the behavior of the pet cards when the width is changed. Checking for different browser window widths will be done with page reloading.

#### Popup

- A popup is a modal window, a separate element that pops up on top of the page when you click anywhere on the card describing a particular pet and is centered. The rest of the page is dimmed. The color of the shadow, the shape of the popup, and the button to close it are defined in the Figma layout design.
- The vertical scroll should become inactive when the popup is opened.
- Nothing happens when you click on the popup window (block).
- When you click outside the popup boundaries, on a darkened area, or on a button with a cross, the popup and the darkening should disappear.
- When the mouse hovers over the darkened area or the button with the cross, i.e. when the `hover` event occurs, the button should get a hover effect. In other words: the button is interactive. In this case, nothing happens when hovering over the popup window (block) itself.
- When you close the popup, the vertical scroll should become active again.
- If you have 768px <= width the popup will have a picture of the pet.
- If width < 768px there is no picture of the pet in the popup design.

### Pets Page

#### Burger menu

- The menu burger will only appear on the page if width < 768px.
- When you click on the menu burger, there will be a 320px wide, full-height block on the right side of the browser window with vertically arranged and centered menu items. There should be a slide-in animation.
- The font color and background are the same as the menu in the _header_ block.
- The area that protrudes beyond 320px must be dimmed. The dimming property is described in the Figma layout design.
- The same rules for activity and inactivity apply to elements as they do to menus on a larger screen width. For example, clicking on `Contacts` should take us to the _Footer_ block, and the menu should close.
- When the menu is opened, the menu icon is rotated 90 degrees. There should be an animation of icon rotation. The vertical scrollbar should become inactive.
- If you click outside the menu boundaries, on a darkened area, or on the button with the burger menu icon, the menu should move back in. A slide-out animation must be present.
- When closing the menu, the menu icon itself rotates back 90 degrees. There should be an animation of icon rotation. The vertical scroll must become active again.
- Logo on the burger menu is duplicated from the main one. It is allowed to make the page logo disappear or be moved to its place in the burger menu when the burger menu is opened.

#### Popup

- A popup is a modal window, a separate element that pops up on top of the page when you click anywhere on the card describing a particular pet and is centered. The rest of the page is dimmed. The color of the shadow, the shape of the popup, and the button to close it are defined in the Figma layout design.
- The vertical scroll should become inactive when the popup is opened.
- Nothing happens when you click on the popup window (block).
- When you click outside the popup boundaries, on a darkened area, or on a button with a cross, the popup and the darkening should disappear.
- When the mouse hovers over the darkened area or the button with the cross, i.e. when the `hover` event occurs, the button should get a hover effect. In other words: the button is interactive. In this case nothing happens when hovering over the popup window (block) itself.
- When you close the popup, the vertical scroll should become active again.
- If you have 768px <= width the popup will have a picture of the pet.
- If width < 768px there is no picture of the pet in the popup design.

#### Pagination

- Pagination is the switching of pages (tables or slides), by redrawing some data to others, the effects can be different: slide, fade. There is always the first page and the last.
- The most important thing: _when the pagination area is the same size, going back to a particular page number, the content on it will always be the same_.
- When you load `Our Pets', an array of 48 elements must be generated in a pseudo-random way. Each of the 8 pets given on the layout must occur exactly 6 times. At the same time, every 8, every 6, and every 3 pets on the page must not be repeated. I.e. there can't be two identical pets on one pagination page at the same time.
- When loading or reloading the browser window, the first page in `Our Pets` must always be active.
- The `<<` button always opens the first page.
- The `<` button opens the previous page before the current page.
- The `>` button opens the next one after the current page.
- The `>>` button always opens the last page.
- The circle in the center shows the number of the current page.
- If the first page is open, the `<<` and `<` buttons are inactive.
- If the last page is open, buttons `>` and `>>` are inactive.
- At 1280px <= width on the page, it shows 8 pets, and the amount of pages is 6. I.e. when you click `>>` opens the sixth page.
- If 768px <= width < 1280px, the page shows 6 pets and 8 pages at the same time. So clicking on `>>` will open the eighth page.
- If the width < 768px, the page shows 3 pets and 16 pages at the same time. I.e. when you click `>>` the sixteenth page opens.
- Switching the behavior of pet cards when changing width is not necessary to do. Checking for different widths of the browser window will be done with a page reload.

## Cross-check evaluation criteria. Week 4

Maximum score for completing all conditions: **100**.

### Main Page & Pets Page

#### Burger menu

With page width < 768px the _burger menu_ is implemented on both pages: **+20**.
If the burger menu is implemented only on one page or is not implemented at all - points for this item are not awarded, the requirements for the implementation of the burger menu are not checked\_.
The _Burger Menu_ on each page must meet the following requirements:

- The _Burger Menu_ is present on the page only when width < 768px.
- When you click on the _Burger-Menu_, a 320px wide and full-height block appears on the right side, with the menu items vertically arranged and centered. Pulling out from the top, not the right, is not considered an error, but in that case, the menu should also pull up, not to the right.
- When the _burger-menu_ is opened, it moves smoothly out from the right (or top) border of the screen (slide-in).
- When the _burger-menu_ is opened, the menu icon rotates smoothly by 90 degrees.
- After opening the _burger menu_, the vertical scroll of the main page becomes inactive. In the menu itself, there can be an active scroll, if all menu items do not fit the height of the browser window.
- The menu items have the same active and inactive rules as the menus on the larger screen width.
- The area beyond 320px is darkened.
- When you click outside the menu boundaries on the darkened area or on the button with the menu icon, the _burger menu_ moves back in.
- When you close the _burger menu_, it moves smoothly beyond the right (or top) border of the screen (slide-out).
- When the _burger-menu_ is closed, the menu icon smoothly rotates back 90 degrees.
- After closing the _burger menu_, the vertical scroll becomes active again.
- If you click on "About the shelter" (on page `main`) or "Our pets" (on page `our pets`) the page is in the initial position, the menu is closed.
- If you click on "About the shelter" (on the page `our pets`) or "Our pets" (on the page `main`), the page will be moved to the corresponding page.
- If you click on "Help", the page scrolls to the _help_ block and then closes the menu (from the `main` page), or redirects us to the _help_ block of the `main` page (from the `our pets` page)
- When you click on "Contacts" the page scrolls to the block _Footer_, the menu closes.
  For each violation of these requirements **-3** points will be deducted, but no more than -20.

---

#### Popup

_Popup_ is implemented on both pages: **+15**.
If the pop-up is implemented on only one page or is not implemented at all - no points are awarded for this point, the requirements for pop-up implementation are not checked\_.
_Popup_ on each page must meet the following requirements:

- When you click anywhere on a card (block) with a description of a particular pet, a _popup_ appears, its content is centered on the width and height of the screen (without taking into account the cross icon on the top right corner).
- The rest of the page outside the popup is darkened.
- Once the popup is opened, the vertical scroll becomes inactive. However, the scroll can be in the popup itself if it is taller than the browser window.
- Nothing happens when you click on the popup window (block).
- When you hover your mouse over a darkened area or a button with a cross on it, i.e. when the `hover` event occurs, the button gets a hover effect. In other words: the button is interactive.
- If you click outside the popup boundaries on a darkened area or on a button with a cross, the popup and the darkening disappear.
- When closed, the vertical scroll becomes active again.
- The pet picture is present at 768px <= width and absent at 768px > width.
  For each violation of the above requirements, **-3** points will be deducted, but no more than -15.
  ‚ùó**Pay attention:** An animation of pop-up is desirable, but not obligatory. Lack of animation is not an error, points for its absence are not reduced!

---

### Main Page

#### Carousel

When you press the _left_ or _right_ buttons, the switching of slides occurs: **+25**.
If pressing the buttons to the left or right does not change the slides - no points are awarded for this point, the requirements for carousel implementation are not checked\_.
The carousel must meet the following requirements:

- When you click on the arrows, you move to a new block of elements.
- The blocks change with a carousel animation. The animation time and timing function does not matter.
- The carousel is infinite and has no boundaries, i.e. you can click left and right as many times as you want, and each time the content in the blocks will be new. In this case, the following scenarios are not considered to be an error:
  - when sliding left and right, the cards are generated anew each time, without retaining the previous state.
  - Cards retain any number of previous states. For example, pressing the _right_ button generates a new block. And after pressing the _left_ button, the block with the previous elements we returned to will be displayed.
- Each new slide contains a **pseudorandom** set of animal cards, i.e. it is formed from the original objects in random order with the following conditions:
  - in the current block of the slide cards with pets are not repeated.
  - there is no duplication of cards with the current block in the next block. For example, in a slider of 3 elements, the next slide will contain 3 (out of 8 available) new pet cards that weren't present among the 3 cards on the previous departed slide.
  - If the cards retain their previous states, make sure that after reloading the page, other card sequences will be generated. The starting slide may be the same when the page loads, but a new set of cards should be generated when you flip to the right or left. If you see that the sequence is the same as it was before the reload, perform the reload a few more times. If after 4 reloads the result has not changed - consider it an error!
- Three checks are performed on three different values of the browser window width, **with page reloading after setting the width**:
  - at 1280px <= width there are 3 pet cards in the slide block. When you click on the arrow, all 3 cards are replaced with new ones.
  - at 768px <= width < 1280px there are 2 pet cards in the slide block. When the arrow is clicked, both cards are replaced with new cards.
  - When width < 768px there is 1 pet card in the slide block. When you click on the arrow the card is replaced with a new one.
    For each violation of the above requirements (both clauses and sub-clauses), **-5** points will be deducted, but no more than -25.

---

### Pets Page

#### Pagination

When you press the _left_ or _right_ buttons, the pet cards switching occurs: **+40**.
If pressing the buttons to the left or right does not change the pages - no points are awarded for this point, the requirements for pagination are not checked\_.
The pagination must meet the following requirements:

- When you switch pages, the data changes (at 1280px <= width the pet cards change their order).
- Whenever the `Our Pets` page is loaded or reloaded in the browser, the first page is always active.
- The `<<` button always opens the first page.
- The `<` button opens the previous page before the current page.
- The button `>` opens the next page after the current page.
- The button `>>` always opens the last page.
- The circle in the center shows the number of the current page. When you switch pages, the number changes to the current page number.
- When the first page opens, the `<<` and `<` buttons are inactive.
- When opening the last page the `>` and `>>` buttons are inactive.
- Each new pagination page contains a **pseudorandom** set of paginates, i.e. it is formed from the original objects in random order with the following conditions:
  - If the size of the pagination area, including the size of the browser window, is unchanged, returning to a page under a particular number will always have the same content on it. That is, the pet cards will be in the same location as they were before going to the other pages.
  - When `Our Pets` is loaded, an array of 48 pet objects is generated. Each of the 8 pets shown on the layout must occur exactly 6 times.
  - At each load, the set of items displayed on the pagination page must be generated randomly. To do this, reload the browser tab 4 or more times, and watch for the order of the pet cards in the pagination to change. At the same time, if there are questions when switching between media queries, you can do the reloading on the screen size that has already been changed.
  - Every 8, every 6, and every 3 pet cards on a page should not be repeated. I.e. there can't be two of the same pet on the same pagination page at the same time.
- Three tests are performed on three different browser window widths, **with page reloading after setting the width**:
  - At 1280px <= width the page simultaneously shows 8 non-repeating pet cards, and the pages themselves - 6. That is, when you click `>>` the sixth page opens.
  - If 768px <= width < 1280px, the page shows 6 non-repeating pet cards and 8 pages at the same time. That is, when you click `>>` the eighth page opens.
  - If width < 768px, the page shows 3 non-repeating pet cards and 16 pages at the same time. That is, when you click `>>` opens the sixteenth page.
    For each violation of the above requirements (both clauses and subclauses), **-5** points will be taken off, but no more than -40.
    ‚ùó**Pay attention:** Page switching pagination effects may or may not be present. Absence of effects \*\*is not an error, points for their absence are not reduced!
